# Project: Flyaway

## Description
Allows user to search flights based on origin, destination and date. My goal for this project was to see how React can work with Rails.
APP uses Rails as a backend API and React as frontend. This separates app into two which communicates via API requests. This approach allows you to decouple the frontend and backend enable it to operate independently. 

## Vite + React + SASS
For this project I will be using Vite for javascript bundler with React and Sass.
I thought about using Vue.js instead of React but I am still learning React so decided to spend more time on it. 
Sass is my go to CSS as I like was it's structured and able to separate different components. 

## API dependencies
This app will be using [Amadeus API](https://www.flightapi.io/flight-status-and-tracking-api) to grab all flight and travel related information.
Including airports, airliner, flight schedule and etc. 

## DB dependencies
